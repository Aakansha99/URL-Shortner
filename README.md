# URL-Shortner
URL shortening is used to create shorter aliases for long URLs. We call these shortened aliases “briefolinks.” Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links. Short links save a lot of space when displayed, printed, messaged, or tweeted. Additionally, users are less likely to mistype shorter URLs.

For example, if we shorten this page through ***Briefolink***:
```
https://www.google.com/search?q=google+images&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjZ2b3H-ePqAhWGA3IKHfgbCYcQ_AUoAXoECA0QAw&biw=1398&bih=656#imgrc=bkfQdb5tebl45M
```
We would get:
<br/>
```
https://briefolink.herokuapp.com/gwqessAZ6
```
The shortened URL is nearly one-third the size of the actual URL.
If you haven’t used https://briefolink.herokuapp.com/ before, please try creating a new shortened URL and spend some time going through the various options their service offers.
